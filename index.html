        <h1> LIKE JENNIE lyrics </h1>
        <p> Ha, c'mon, it's gonna be fuckin' hard <br>
Special edition
And your AI couldn't copy <br>
I'm leavin' clues in the fittin' room
And it's hot tea <br> 
No, I'm not thinking 'bout no exes
Know they miss me <br>
I got the whole room spinnin' like it's tipsy
(Don't bore us, take you to the chorus)<br>
Who wanna rock with JENNIE?<br>
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE<br>
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?<br>
Like, like, like<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE (I think I really like)<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE (haters, they don't really like)<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE ('cause they could never, ever be)<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE (but have you ever met)<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?<br>
JENNIE (JENNIE, JENNIE)<br>
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
JENNIE (but have you ever met-)
But have you ever met-<br>
But have you ever met-<br>
얼말 줘도 못해, 서커스짓<br>
포징 한 번에 만들어, mosh pit<br>
They can't deal with me, 'cause I'm priceless<br>
여러 셀럽들 속에, 내 DNA<br>
Get, get outta my way<br>
바비가 처키가 되기 전에<br>
Name, shame, blame, tryna burst my bubble<br>
터트려봐, 그럼 더 큰 홀에서 만나는 거야<br>
제니를 keep shadin'<br>
예술작품엔 필요해, frame이<br>
I've slayed it, and I graved it<br>
Yes, I'm guilty, 잘난 게 죄니 (mm)<br>
Who wanna rock with JENNIE?<br>
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE<br>
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?<br>
Like, like, like<br>
I think I really like (JENNIE)<br>
Haters, they don't really like (JENNIE)<br>
'Cause they could never, ever be (JENNIE)<br>
But have you ever met<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE<br>
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE<br>
Like JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE<br>
Rock with JENNIE<br>
Keep your hair done, nails done, like JENNIE<br>
Who else got 'em obsessed, like-<br>
But have you ever met JENNIE?<br>
But have you ever met<br>
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?<br>
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE<br> </p>
